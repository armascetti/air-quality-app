# Next Steps: 
 ## The Graph: 
I need to continue working on the graph. Right now the data is coming in as (many) mutliple objects. That is why there are many graphs being displayed. 
  To do this I need to: map through the data to create a new array to display the specific data  I would like to display in one complete graph. 
  I would also like display this data in a more appropriate way. A scatter plot is needed over a bar graph to represent the data in a more user friendly and logical way. 
  ## Styling: 
  The style needs to look more like a professional site. I would like to center the page more using grid and/or flex. 
  ## The dropdown: 
    My original idea was to click a location from the drop down to render the measurement graphs.
